# GroovyMaterial

### Importance
    inspired by python , ruby  smalltalk 
    consice and flat language
    easy to write in groovy, compared to java, but creates jar binaries
    Integrates with existing java code

    meta programming
    static compilation
    DSL - domain specific languages
    scripting and testing glues

### History: 
    Groovy was created by James Strachan in 2003. It was designed to be a companion language for Java, offering more flexibility and concise syntax.

### Use Cases:
    Scripting and automation.
    Rapid application development.
    Building DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages).
    Testing frameworks (e.g., Spock).
    Build tools (e.g., Gradle).

### Groovy vs Java

    Syntax: Groovy is more concise with optional semicolons, parentheses, and type declarations.
    Dynamic Typing: Groovy supports dynamic typing, whereas Java is statically typed.
    Default Imports: Groovy includes many default imports, reducing the need for explicit imports.
    Getters and Setters: Groovy automatically provides getters and setters for class properties.
    Closures: Groovy has first-class support for closures, which are similar to Java lambdas but more powerful.
